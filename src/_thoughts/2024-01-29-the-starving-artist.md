I believe artists crave originality . 

I think what makes them artists is their strong desire to be original . Perhaps it is their primary desire , the strongest one besides their primary needs of food , shelter , water . 

Beyond that , they hold onto their originality , it defines them . They believe originality is simply more interesting than following the crowd , molding ourselves to others' expectations , or even the confines of society . 

But originality and value do not always align . 

What is inherently original may not be valuable . Particularly in the existing systems of value . 

For if a work is original , truly original , how would we know what to value it ? It exists outside the traditional system . 

Value is strongly tied to what already exists , what works , what generates more of said value . Everything outside of that system can be said to be unvaluable . 

Of course , there are works of art and artists who have generated lots of value for themselves and others . And to do so wouldn't make them unoriginal . I'm just saying there are artsits who will continue doing work they believe in , even if it doesn't garner attention , simply because . 

If , by luck , their original work takes off , they'd be all the happier for it . But their primary concern is original work , and not profitable work .

I think the greatest innovations are the result of artists and original thinkers . And I would say , they probably aren't even the ones who profit most from it . 

It's because their concern is never profit , it's simply to explore .
