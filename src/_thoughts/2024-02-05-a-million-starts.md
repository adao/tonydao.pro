a million starts in our lifetime . each one as hard as the previous .<br/>
it never gets easier . embarking on an unknown journey .<br/>
we don't know when we'll finish , or even what the path's going to look like .<br/>
it takes us away . from our homes , our friends , our family , our comfort . <br/>
then , one day , out of the blue , it looks like we're about to finish . <br/>
and we get excited . we get excited that we're finally going to be done . <br/>
then one thing comes up , then another . then another .<br/>
and before we're even done , we find ourselves working on something else . <br/>
and we start again . a million and one . and we wonder . <br/>
will we ever be home again .
