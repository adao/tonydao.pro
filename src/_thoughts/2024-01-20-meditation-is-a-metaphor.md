Meditation is both a practice and a metaphor .

In the meditation that I'm familiar with , there is the practice of returning to center , which is a sort of empty space devoid of our mental chatter .

It's noticing when your mind wanders , and coming back . That's the practice .

So , how's it a metaphor ?

For example , when you catch yourself doing something mindlessly . It could be scrolling social media , watching Netflix , eating ... If you catch yourself , you can then stop that activity and return to your life . 

Meditation is not actually an activity in itself , as in we don't sit and meditate . That would be the metaphor . 

What is it a metaphor for ? Living consciously , not wasting time , and not getting lost .
