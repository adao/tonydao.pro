If you can get someone to perceive something as valuable , you can get them to exchange money for the perception , whether or not it actually delivers value or not . 

And with the money , you can buy things of actual value .

I feel like this is what I'm witnessing all over the internet . 

Where this gets interesting is Who gets to say what is perceived value and what is actual value . If the $$$ exchanges hands , who on the outside of the deal , is to say whether one gets ripped off or not , after all , isn't it just my opinion ? 

True . I can't say definitively what is valuable and what isn't . But I still get to have my opinion , and I have that opinion every time I see a product marketed at some obscene price , I look into it , and I decide not to buy it . Every time that decision is made , I am unconsciously delcaring , this "product" is not worth that $ amount . 

Then someone else comes along after me , maybe dozens , hundreds , thousands of people later , someone decides , this seems valuable ... and they buy it . That's the story of the internet . What actually happens , is they're unable to tap into the collective conscience of the thousands of people who'd passed by and didn't buy . Because the internet is often a very lone experience . Sometimes it's just you and that page you're viewing , and your feelings , and the marketer's promise of a better life , more health , better relationships , more money , more secrets , etc. So , ya buy . 

And maybe your life does improve , maybe the product does deliver on its value . And / or maybe it doesn't , and you're pissed . Or you don't even care , because it wasn't that much money anyway . But moreso , was it a waste of time ?

Is it a waste of time for any marketer to marketing some bullshit product or offer ? Even if they justify it by saying , well it's up to the buyer if they want to buy or not . Well , then I'd argue you're just wasting everybody's time at that point . Even if they make the decision to not buy , you still took up some of their mindshare , and for what . Just tried to prey on their weakness . 

But how valuable is their time in the first place ? One could say invaluable . That time is the most precious resource . On the other hand , if they're giving you their time like that ... then maybe it's not so valuable , or they don't value their time , don't know the value of their time . Or they don't know what to do with their time , and so they're just listening for ideas on what to do .

Do I know what to do with my time ?
