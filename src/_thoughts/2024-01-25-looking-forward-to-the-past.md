I find myself often looking forward to the past . 

Recently , it's been of a karaoke bar I frequented in 2022 . 

I was a regular there and got to know the other regulars , both the ones that came to drink and the ones that came to sing . 

Every weekend , we drank , smoked , and hung out . 

It was one of the most fun times I can remember .

But I didn't like that it was what I did *every weekend* . I didn't like how I would feel some mornings after . Weekends would roll around and I wished I had something else to do , but I didn't . So I found myself going to that bar , again and again . 

Eventually , I moved out of the city . Life's taken me elsewhere , and I've finally found a bit of that drive to focus on my other pursuits . 

Still , I romanticize those nights at the bar . I think of the day I'll come back to that city , have a drink , and go up for a song . Chat with the regulars , huddle up at the single outside table and have a smoke with everyone . 

I wonder if it's ideal , looking forward to the past . And if I shouldn't be more focused on the future . 

I don't know if I'll ever find a place like it again , that'll match the ambiance , the people , and the vibe . I don't think I will .
