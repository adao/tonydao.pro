Some days you wake up feelin' like the world is yours for the taking . And some days you wake up feelin' like just another aimless soul .

Your dreams from yesterday don't carry the same weight today . The ferocity you felt has left you . What then ? 

You aren't sad , miserable , morose . No ... you're just not what you were yesterday . What do you do when that motivation , that energy , leaves you ? 

Discipline ? Do you force it ? Do you stick to the schedule you've set for yourself ? 

To each their own . What one man does does not dictate what all men should do (choose your role models carefully) 

I'm sitting here writing this because this is what I'm feeling at the moment . I don't have an answer quite yet . But I can tell you there's absolutely nothing wrong with this moment . It's actually quiet and quite peaceful . A stark contrast to the feelings of yesterday .

Perhaps enjoy it .
