There comes a time in your life where you decide you will be the one to protect yourself .

I'm sure it happens differently for each person , and at different points in our lives . But it's a poignant point, I'm sure .

We're born into the world with so many protectors . Our parents , siblings , aunts , uncles , family friends . 

As we grow older , we have less need for them . We grow further apart , and we grow away from them . 

We find our own friends , and friends are different . They're our buddies , the ones we want to explore this world with . 

And eventually , all we want to do is explore . And it seems we have no need for any of our old protectors . 

And that's sad . Not for us , but for them . Because they took joy in looking out for us . They found purpose in being needed .

But that is the path we all take . To become our own protector , our last protector . 

That's our destiny .
