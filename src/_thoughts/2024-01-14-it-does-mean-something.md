You want everything you've gone through to mean something . Like you want all the pain that you've endured to set you apart from the rest . That's too much . 

See , it does mean something . It has amounted to something . Everything you've been through has gotten you to where you are today . That's what it was all for . Nothing more though . 

To want it to mean more ... is greedy . That's wanting it to perform double-duty . Impossible . 

It's made you who you are . You want it to have made you who you are and what's to come ? 

What's to come is your new responsibility . You'll have to take everything you know â€” really , just the person you are now , and build your future . 

Everything you've gone through is *everything* , and it's **now**.
