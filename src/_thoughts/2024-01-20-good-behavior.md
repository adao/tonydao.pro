Fuck professionalism and "good behavior" . 

If you play into that , there'll come a time for you to "be bad" and you won't be able to do it because you've played too much into this idea of being professional , or polite , or nice . 

Being bad is just being confrontational , being in opposition to someone else's sense of reality , and being able to hold that position . It's important to be able to do that .
