It's just the way humans are . We want things that will improve our position in life . Maybe that's how everything is .

Actually, I don't think so . 

I think there are humans that are content without more . There are humans that are content with less . Maybe they're happier , maybe they're not . But you won't see marketers marketing to those humans , you can't trick a person who wants less into wanting more . 

For those who want more , it's not that they inherently want more , it's that they are *fundamentally not content* with themselves as they are . And with these ill-content people , it's very easy to tell them that something external will fix their problems . Will bring them more joy , more happiness , more money . Could be their diet , their relationship , their finances , etc. 

Hmmmmm . It's not "bad" per se to work on any of the aforementioned things either . After all , improving those areas of life seems like a reasonable thing to do . 

It's just that everybody's in such a rush to get results these days . And results are the things everyone seems to be selling .

Marketers: "Buy this , you'll get results."  
Marketers: "Read this , you'll get results."  
Marketers: "Do this , you'll get results."  
Marketers: "Use this , you'll get results."  
Also marketers: "We don't promise results for everybody"

Customers: "I got the result!"  
And the proportion ( large or small ) of customers that didn't get the results marketed , you'll probably never hear about â€” especially not on the marketing page . 

None of this is good or bad per se . I , too , want results . 

But I also just want to enjoy the journey , and I want to be okay with the results that I get , whatever they are . I don't buy that your results are the only results worth striving for ... And that's what they're actually selling you , their version of success . But that's just it , it's *their version* of success . 

... which probably plays into some larger , societal concept of "success" .

Ah , yes ... fuck it all .
