We got to up the stakes of our life . 

We got to have the feelin' that if we're not completely focused , completed dialed in , committed , loyal to our vision , to our goals , that we're goin' to lose and lose in a bad way . 

I need to be as emotionally invested in my life as I am in the characters that I watch on television . The same way that I want these characters to win in the shows that I watch , I need to have that for me . 

I need to use my imagination , the same tool I have to make-believe what I watch on TV as real , to make-believe that every single thing I do matters . And every single thing I do gets me either closer or further from my goals . 

I wouldn't watch a protagonist on TV who's lazy and skimps and complains ... no , no , no . I watch the guys that are dedicated , focused , who don't get thrown off their game , who face challenges and find ways to overcome them . Who are resilient , who are noble and have values . Not the guy not working ... Not the guy who's overly indecisive , who complains about everything . I'm watching the guy who's doin' what he can with what he can and facing it all . 

That's the guy I want to be .
