You've got a lot of anger . It's not undue . There's a reason for all of it . But at the same time , it's served its purpose . 

It's time to let go of it . The journey ahead ? Anger's not going to serve you . It won't serve anyone . 

It had its time , its place . It got you out of the situation you were in . 

Now it's time to move forward , into a calmer , better , brighter future . A safer future . 

You got this .
