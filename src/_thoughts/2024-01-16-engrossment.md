The idea of being engrossed . 

You hear a lot of social media these days about dopamine addiction . It took me awhile to figure out what it meant , but eventually I got it . 

But it's still sort of a foreign concept , and very scientific in how it's presented , and addiction is another word that's terribly confusing and divisive in its own right . 

To explain in another way , it is the state of being engrossed . It's where you're totally absorbed by what you're doing . When people talk about dopamine addiction , I've heard it spoken about in largely two contexts: scrolling social media and watching Netflix . Though there are plenty of other means , even reading fiction could be equated with dopamine addiction . 

It's that state where you tune out the external world , when an hour can go by and it feels like barely any time has passed . Being engrossed is a completely objective state , but it's what is holding your attention that makes it "good" or "bad" . 

And again , it's all context dependent . If I'm in ton of pain , maybe I want to be engrossed in scrolling or Netflix or food to avoid that pain . Maybe I want to run 10 miles so I don't have to think about something else that's bothering me and I can just think about my breath and each step I'm taking . 

The state of being engrossed is something I think we should strive towards . But we got to be conscious about what we're engrossed in . Social media and Netflix ... well , I would argue they don't meaningfully add value to your life . I still do it , in moderation . But , in truth , I would drop it if I could find something that I could just as easily get lost in . 

I do have a few of those . Working out , writing , and coding . 

But when you compare the effort required for those activites against scrolling and hitting play on Netflix , you can see why one is easier to fall into .
