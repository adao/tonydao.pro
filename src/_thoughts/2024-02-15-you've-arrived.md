at some point in college , i got tired of being a student . 

actually , it was probably earlier . it was my senior year in high school , after i'd been accepted into college , that i *really* got fed up with being a student . 

it was the first time i felt the pressure valve of being a student totally released .

cause in my household , school was all about getting into college . so when it was nearing its end , school essentially lost its meaning , it had accomplished its goal .

and when college started , i must have took some of that energy with me . it was never apparent , but underneath the surface , i perceived school as just another obstacle to get through until i could graduate and enter the "real world" . 

and i did eventually graduate . but i think when you approach school with that mindset , you lose out on a lot of the actual benefits of university . you're there , but you don't really see the point in it , you're just going through it to be going through it . you're half-assing it . you might as well go out into the real world if that's your mindset about school . 

but you tell yourself , or your parents tell you , or your parents program you and you begin to tell yourself , this is all to get a good job , to get to the next step . 

so you slog your way through university . and you graduate , like your peers . and you get a job , like your peers , and you think , or you've convinced yourself , that this is going to be worth it . you believe it . 

you think , school sucked, university kinda sucked (not all of it , just the schooling part) , ok , this job , it's going to be better . 

but it's not . and there's so many reasons it's not . but the big one for me â€” is the people . it's like , throughout school and university , there was always authority . and you imagine that when you get into the workplace , you get to be the adult , there is no more authority , you can set the rules , we can set the rules . hell , work might even be fun , might even be enjoyable .

but it's not . it's not . it's more of the same . arbitrary deadlines , people abusing their authority , hierarchy , corporate structures , societal structures , etc. etc. 

and you find yourself disappointed , all the time , in your fellows . it's no longer *them* , the powers that be . it's you , it's us .

and , i guess , through all of this , you learn it's never going to be perfect . that , in fact , the whole time you should have been fighting to make things better . that there's always going to be an oppressor , a person who likes to shit on others . that there is no waiting , no waiting for a better time to come , or for someone else to come and make it better , that it's on you to make things better . for every one . for yourself . and it's going to be a constant battle . it'll be every day . there is no rest state , no final destination .

and once here , maybe you've finally arrived .
